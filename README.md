# ASL Identification

A Set of Models to identify the American Sign Language Alphabet inside of images.

## Overivew

American Sign Language, as well as the variations of signing around the world, are an important device of communication for those hard of hearing
and hard of speaking.  The use of AI to auto translate sign language to text would increase the quality of life for those who find it difficult to 
get others to understand them.

This is a small study using only the alphabet found in ASL to demonstrate the potential for Convolutional Neural Networks to translate ASL to English.

## Use and Install

This project was coded on a local machine using Python 3.10.7 and the packages described in the included requirements.txt. To mimic this environment, simply clone said repository on a local machine and run the following python command in your desired location.

pip install -r requirements.txt

This project used a virtual environment.

As a Jupyter Notebook, web applications such as Google Colab will be a servicable alternative, and the project should work fine as long as the data is loaded in appropriately.

The data used for the project is located here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet?resource=download

The contents need simply be unzipped and placed into a /data folder.
